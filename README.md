# Career Ladder

This ladder was developed by [Daniel Blumenthal](https://www.linkedin.com/in/danielblumenthal/) and [Arnaud Lucas](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lucasarn/). We hope you will find it useful.

### On titles

We have avoided the use of specific titles (Software Engineer, Senior Software Engineer, Principal Ninja, Magister Ludi, etc.) in order to focus on the essential expectations at each level.

### The levels

* [L1](L1.md)
* [L2](L2.md)
* [L3](L3.md)
* [L4](L4.md)
* [L5](L5.md)
* [L6](L6.md)

### TODO

At some point, we will need to do manager levels. (any volunteers?)
