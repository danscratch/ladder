L6s are role models, leaders, and irreplaceable technical resources. They set the bar for excellence and effectiveness at the company.

The following sections provide more details on expectations for an L6.

#### Impact

As the organization’s most senior technical contributors, L6s are heavily involved in the design, implementation, and long-term maintenance of critical shared infrastructure. They are deeply knowledgeable about the technical stack, from the presentation layer to the physical hardware, SaaS providers, and physical infrastructure. They have experience in product-focused development, infrastructure, operations, and logistics, and use their extensive experience to drive a strategic technical vision.

L6s have an encyclopedic knowledge of frameworks, technologies, and industry trends. They are focused on business results, and are able to balance architectural goals with practical considerations, long-term strategic vision with short- and medium-term business goals. They are able to plan and implement roadmaps that deliver immediate needs while building to the desired end states.

L6s are extraordinarily effective at achieving business results. They are prodigious producers of high quality, maintainable, performant code. They have well-developed networks within the company, and know how to get things done, both through official and unofficial means. They are able to balance coding work with support of the engineering organization and collaboration with business partners. They consistently demonstrate excellent judgment.

#### Ownership

L6s are responsible for the company’s technology. They have broad knowledge of all major system components, and deep knowledge of many. They take responsibility for shepherding the technology forward, and are able to reconcile practical needs and strategic goals. They are responsible for helping to create the company’s long-term technical vision, and take ownership of one or more major components.

L6s take responsibility for uptime of major systems, and of the site overall. They work closely with operations teams, and are familiar with the various components of the site’s tech stack, data architecture, hardware infrastructure, and continuous integration, release, and configuration management systems.

#### Process

L6s work actively to reduce toil for engineers across the organization. This includes reducing or removing existing process through automation and/or simplification, and guarding against addition of new, unnecessary process.

#### Culture

L6s are exemplars and missionaries of the company's values and culture, and are looked up to as role models, mentors, and teachers.

#### Communication

L6s communicate effectively, in writing and verbally, with both technical and non-technical colleagues. They are able to organize, facilitate, and participate in group discussions to get to optimal decisions. They are expert listeners.

#### Growth

L6 is not a static role. They continue to deepen and update their knowledge and skills in their areas of greatest expertise. They keep up with industry trends, constantly evaluating new languages, tools, methodologies, processes, architectures, etc. They actively learn technologies critical to the company’s short- and long-term success. They actively seek out information - technical or otherwise - that will help them drive positive business results.

#### Leadership

L6s are responsible for shaping technical strategy through the lens of business goals. They are responsible for taking this vision, breaking it down into concrete pieces, and directing large-scale projects to build and operationalize these pieces. They actively work to diffuse critical knowledge, and build strategic skills, throughout the organization.

### Anti-patterns

* **Arrogance**. It can be easy for senior engineers to stop listening, and to aggressively push their own views. This is understandable - after all, they’ve been promoted to their current role for their strong skills, knowledge, and record of accomplishment. However, arrogance leads to a toxic workplace in which people are afraid to voice dissent, technical decisions are made based on seniority rather than merit, and good people leave for healthier environments.
* **Excuses**. This can be a problem at any level, but is of particular concern at the most senior levels. There can be reasons - even good ones - for technical failures, but at the end of the day business results are what matter. When failures occur - and they will - focus on the objective facts and what you will do to get to a better result next time - not on dodging responsibility or pointing fingers.
* **Eminence**. Continuous growth is a job requirement for all engineers, at all levels. When you don’t know anything, it’s easy to pick up new things, because you’re equally inexperienced at everything. When you’ve spent years mastering a technology, it can be tempting to try to use it as the solution for everything, no matter how inappropriate. L6s are expected to constantly be learning and evaluating new technologies, and considering the long-term impacts (good and bad) of introducing them to the organization.
